# Winter_of_Code_Submission
This repository contains the code as well predictions that were made for the Winter of Code competition.

The project aims to develop a machine learning library by implementing six machine learning algorithms from scratch:
1. Linear Regression (and Polynomial Regression)
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
4. K-Means Clustering
5. Decision Trees
6. N-Layer Neural Network
